# Classic Pong Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls a paddle on the left side of the screen using the up and down arrow keys, while the AI controls a paddle on the right side.

## Features

- Player paddle controlled with arrow keys
- AI paddle that follows the ball
- Collision detection between the ball and paddles
- Score tracking (future enhancement)
- Simple and clean user interface

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the up and down arrow keys to move the player paddle.
3. Try to hit the ball past the AI paddle to score points.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the canvas element.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the canvas and the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and rendering.
